      <p>
         FestiveGear is a one-stop shopping site for people packing for a music
         festival. Users may shop for blankets and low-profile chairs for the 
         field, tents and furniture for the campsite, water toys and inflatable
         rafts for the lake, and musical instruments for late-night jams.
